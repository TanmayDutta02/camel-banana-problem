Aim :- 
  To find the maximum number of bananas that can be delivered by camel to the market.
  
Procedure:-
  We have a total of 3000 bananas.
  The destination is 1000KMs
  Only 1 mode of transport.
  Camel can carry a maximum of 1000 banana at a time.
  Camel eats a banana every km it travels.
  With all these points, we can say that person wonâ€™t we able to transfer any banana
  to the destination as the camel is going to eat all the banana on its way to the
  destination.
  But the trick here is to have intermediate drop points, then, the camel can make
  several short trips in between.
  Also, we try to maintain the number of bananas at each point to be multiple of
  1000.
